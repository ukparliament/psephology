  #   # Create a remote_ip method for a rack request by setting it to the Cloudflare connecting ip header.
  #   # To restore original visitor IP addresses at your origin web server, Cloudflare recommends your logs or applications look at CF-Connecting-IP instead of X-Forwarded-For, since CF-Connecting-IP has a consistent format containing only one IP.

  #   # This checks the request IP against the Cloudflare IP ranges and the action dispatch default trusted proxies.
  #   # These include various local IPs like 127.0.0.1 so that local requests won't be blocked.
